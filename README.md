These applications take user input via prompts and then apply conditional statements in order to display the correct message based on the condition.
The first app decides if the user has completed writing their essay based on the condition that the essay must be 2000 words. If the user enters a number less than 2000, they are told that they must write more. If the user enters a number greater than 2000, they are told that they are done and may take a break. 
The second app is a price per credit hour calculator. The user enters how many credit hours they are taking. The app then computes the credit hours based on the conditions that 1-12 credit hours is $284 per hour. Credit hours equaling 13 or more is calculated at $229 per credit hour. The result is displayed on the screen.
